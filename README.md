# rishir007.github.io

1. Rishi Rampersad rrrampersad@my.waketech.edu

2. My GitHub account username rishir007 is currently being used for CTI-110.

3. The rishi007.github.io repository contains this readme.md file for CTI-110 Lesson 6 lab.

4. To clone the repository to my desktop I used GitHub Desktop for Windows. After logging in with my GitHub credentials there was a tab with the option on the home screen to "Clone a repository from the internet." Choosing that option I was asked to select which of my repositories to clone and asked to determine where on my local computer I wanted to store the repository.
